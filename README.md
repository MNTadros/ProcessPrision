# What is this?

Hackducky is hackclubs own version of making a USB rubber ducky built by hackclubers.A usb rubber ducky is basically something that looks like a USB but is actually a trojan. It pretends to be a keyboard to the computer allowing you to basically take control of the computer you plug it into

## What you get

- Hackducky Board
    -  Dual USB ports (USB-A and USB-C)
    -  LED for the status and spare LED!- you can use it for other things if you like !
    -  Button for any extra features you may want to add !
    -  All duckyscripts are stored in the Hackduckys SD Card!
    -  Debug points to use it as a devboard!


## Getting Started

1. Follow the guide on the website! - hackducky.hackclub.com

# Submission Criteria  

## 1. Time Requirement  
- **Tracking:** Minimum of **5** hours tracked with hackatime .
- Note on the requirements. I understand it doesnt take 5 hours to build a single script or even many in duckyscript so here's what you can do, If you want to excecute a python file then compile the file to exe or whatever excecutable form you need, Upload it somewhere public and then create a simple duckyscript to download and run it. You can totally spend more time on the python script and make it complex or for the challenge spend 5 hours on your duckyscript!  

## 4. Originality  
- Your project must be an **original idea** and not a direct copy from a tutorial.  
- Tutorials can be referenced, but your submission should be your own creation.  

## 5. Submission Limit  
- You can submit **multiple projects**, but you can only receive **one HackDucky**.  


## What the LED indicators mean

- Triple blink: Startup Sequence
- Single blink: Working/Processing - running/Starting Execution
- Rapid blinking: DuckyScript is incorrect / Firmware broke ðŸ˜­ - Create a PR or new issue desribing the firmware problem

## Troubleshooting the LED's

1. LED rapidly blinking at startup:
 - Programming Mode
    - All is working great!
    - Its meant to blink rapidly in this mode
 - Payload Mode
       - Something is wrong with your duckyscript
       - Something is wrong with the firmware ( Create an Issue! )

3. Script not running:
   - Check script syntax
   - Verify file is properly saved
   - Try reformatting MicroSD card

4. Keyboard not recognized:
   - Try different USB port
   - Check USB connection
   - Verify target system supports USB HID

## Safety Notes
